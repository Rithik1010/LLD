# Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes its state, all its dependent objects (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is commonly used in implementing distributed event-handling systems.

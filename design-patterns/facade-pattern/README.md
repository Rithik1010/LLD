# Decorator Pattern

It provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

## Problem Scenario:

Imagine you have a complex system with multiple subsystems, like a home theater system. Each subsystem (e.g., DVD player, projector, sound system) has its own interface.

## Solution:

Use a facade to simplify the interaction with the home theater system by providing a unified interface.

## Components:

    1.	Subsystem Classes: Complex components with their own interfaces.
    2.	Facade Class: Simplified interface that interacts with subsystem classes.
